## Reporting a Vulnerability

You are welcome to report a security vulnerability by opening a GitHub
issue, or if it feels more appropriate, you may send an email to
<a href="mailto:joshooaj@gmail.com?subject=SECURITY DISCLOSURE">joshooaj@gmail.com</a>
with "SECURITY DISCLOSURE" in the subject.

I will make an effort to address the issue within 30 days. If you are able
to provide sample code to demonstrate the issue, or submit a pull request
with your proposed fix, that would be a great help.
